# CV-Project
Computer vision project

This project uses a Raspberry Pi 4 and a Raspberry Pi Camera Modul along with Python and CV2 to perform various computer vision tasks.

## 1. Pattern Detection
Pattern detection using colored shapes. This program can detect various shapes including rectangles, squares, triangles and hexagons by using CV2 color maps. A simple pattern password program was implemented as well as an interactive showcase.

## 2. Object Tracker
Object tracker using CV2 color masks. This program will find the requested color in the image and follow its center real-time.

## 3. Object Tracking Robot
To integrate all, we developed a simple 2DOF robot using servos. The STL files can be also found in the project. This robot uses PID controllers to keep it looking at the object it is tracking
